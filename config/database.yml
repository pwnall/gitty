# use *dev_pgsql or *dev_mysql, depending on which db engine you want
development:
  <<: *dev_mysql

# Warning: The database defined as 'test' will be erased and
# re-generated from your development database when you run 'rake'.
# Do not set this db to the same as development or production.
test:
  <<: *test_mysql

# This section is rewritten by rpwn. For development, it's pointing to the
# -dev database, so we can run the loader scripts in production mode.
production:
